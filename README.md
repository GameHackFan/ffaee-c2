Known Bugs:
- If Haggar grabs Axl or Slash and the other player hits them in a frame they will block, they will get stuck in air for a few seconds, they also might fall on top of barrels (bug present in the original game).
- Roxy and Poison sometimes get stuck in a crouch animation and they can't be hit (bug present in the original game).
- If you kill an enemy with Haggar's Suplex or Pile Driver and an Andore stomp you at the correct time, the enemy might become invincible, [check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_6129sQOU) (bug present in the original game).
- It is possible to kill the last boss (Belger) before he goes to the corner, which leads to a bugged animation of him falling through the window (bug present in the original game).
- Enemies sometimes spawn with weird palletes (3rd and 4th stage).
- Bugged sprite layers (3rd, 5th and 6th stage?).
